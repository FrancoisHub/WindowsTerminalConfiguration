[Microsoft Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) can be customized by editing the settings.json file which is located in the %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState directory.

- Powershell
- Powershell 32 bit
- Command prompt
- Powershell Core
- Azure Cloud Shell
- Command prompt for Visual Studio 2019
- Powershell for Visual Studio 2019
